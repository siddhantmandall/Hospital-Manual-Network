The main objective of this project is to design a network for a hospital with given
constraints. With the given constraints, we have a Main block with 10 nodes and
three Clinical wards with five nodes each connected to the main block. The main
block also includes two additional floors with one node each. All these nodes are
dynamically assigned IP addresses through a server in the main block using
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). We also set up a simple webpage
on our website and gave it a generic name using a Domain Name Subsystem(DNS)
Server.
